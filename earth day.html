<p style="color:blue;">The world's population has doubled since the 1970s, and per capita usage has grown by 45 percent.To satisfy growing human demands for commodities such as food, oil, and wood, the earth is gradually handled in a way that maximises the flow of material from nature.As a result, humans have altered at least 70% of the Earth's soil, mostly for the purpose of growing plants and maintaining animals. These practises include erosion, habitat destruction, habitat loss, which pollution, which have the greatest effects on land and freshwater habitats.</p>
<p style="color:red;"> Changes in land and sea use, exploitation, climate change, pollution, and the proliferation of invasive species are the major causes of habitat destruction.The disposal of garbage into the ocean, for example, has a significant effect on humanity.Most factors are more indirect. This involve demographic, technological, political, and administrative structures, many of which are based on social principles and connect.<br />
A study shows three separate scenarios to see how the future will change.<br />
1. Global sustainability: the whole planet moves toward sustainability by upholding environmental borders and ensuring that everybody benefits from economic growth. Wealth is allocated fairly, money and energies are used more sparingly, and economic development and human well-being are prioritised.<br />
2. Regional competition: nationalism is on the increase, with an emphasis on domestic problems. Education receives less funding, particularly in developed countries. High-income countries will continue to export the harm, leaving future generations to cope with significant and long-term environmental degradation. <br />
3. Economic optimism: the world believes in yet-to-be-invented modern and creative technology that can help us deal with environmental issues. Emissions will continue, but in the hope that technological advancements will reduce them. Health and education will get more funding, and world economies will be more interconnected with common priorities.<br />

<p style="color:green;"> Combating the lack of ecosystems goes to be complicated and could require a nexus technique. This approach considering how extraordinary additives of the trouble which includes nature, politics and socioeconomics all have interaction with one another.
An instance of a nexus technique might be to lessen biodiversity loss with the aid of using converting how we farm, at the same time as on the identical time ensuring human beings have sufficient food, their livelihoods aren't undermined, and social conflicts aren't aggravated.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;">A way to keep away from a number of those problems can be to recognition on regenerating and restoring high-carbon ecosystems along with forests and wetlands. Similarly the want for meals can be met through converting nutritional alternatives and lowering waste.</p>
